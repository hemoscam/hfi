HFI donation income amounting to ₹8,60,252 was not booked under the HFI income ledger but was instead parked in the Andra Feiba dummy account and treated as a mutual funding pool. Voucher 1055 shows ₹25,000 paid towards hotel stay for Prem’s US visit (voucher date: 3 July 2018; effective date: 25 May 2018). Voucher 3356 further confirms that the same Andra Fund was repeatedly used to support foreign travel of multiple individuals.
