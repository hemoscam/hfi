Acknowledgement mail dated 3 June 2018 confirms Jagdish Sharma thanking Vikash Goyal for a “friendly adjustment” of his Glasgow hotel bill exceeding ₹72,000. No corresponding voucher or ledger entry exists. The expense appears disguised through Voucher 3892 under prepaid WHD expenses, indicating off-book settlement routed through third-party adjustments.
